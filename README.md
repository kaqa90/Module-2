# Shopping List Check Off Assignment - Week 2
The idea of this assignment is to create a "check off" shopping List application.

Think of being in a store with a shopping list that allows you to "check off" the items you've already bought, except instead of checking them off, the bought item simply moves to the "Already Bought" list.
